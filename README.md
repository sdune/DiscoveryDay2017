## Parasitic Genomes â€“ What Can Their DNA Tell Us

Farmers in Alberta are sometimes in trouble - their cows can be infected with parasites or other pathogens. You think treatment is easy? 
Find out which parasite your cow is infected with and save your cow with the right treatment.


1. Select a fasta file from the folder 'fastaFiles'. 
2. Copy all sequences and paste them into the field on the BLAST website (Nucleotide BLAST)
3. Look at the results; Which organism are your sequences from? 
4. Treatment for your cow: Find information on treatment for each parasite from the Wasmuth lab website. 
5. Get the drugs for treatment from your Vet! 


**NCBI BLAST website:**
